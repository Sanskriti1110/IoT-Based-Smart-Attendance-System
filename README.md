# IoT-Based-Smart-Attendance-System-using-IBM-Cloud-Services-and-OpenCV
This project deals  with one of the most efficient and accurate Attendance systems based on facial Recognition.  Face recognition provides an accurate method that solves ambiguities such as fraudulent  attendance and time consumption since it is understood that any human's primary identity is their  face. This project uses OpenCv library with python to register, train, and recognize face of a  particular individual through a front-end on Node-RED dashboard and then store the data of the  individual whose is not recognized into IBM Cloud Object and Cloudant database and notify the  admin with a SMS consisting of the link where the image taken of that individual is stored. It  also uses the excel sheet to mark the people present on the particular day.
